The standard go to file format when it comes to exchanging structured data between companies or within large companies still is in the year 2021 the CSV (comma separator values) file format. The reason is surely because it's so simple:

`name, email 
Steve Apple, steve@apple.com 
Mike Bryan, mikebryan@foo.net`

It is by no means a format that is only used by tech people or scientists. A lot of roles in big or small companies are in touch with CSV files (or should get in touch!). Let it be exports from a CRM, analytics data or product data to name a few examples. These data go mostly also through business departments.

Now what happens, when this data needs to be manipulated slightly? Usually it never comes out of a system in the perfect desired format: 

Wrong date format, a column needs to be split, two files need to be merged, you must filter the data, transpose it, join it with another file, look for patterns, convert it, enrich it with other data, ... the list goes on and on.

In most of these cases a spreadsheet tool like Excel or Google Sheets will do the job. If you have some experience with Excel, then even better.

But what happens if:
* you work on a file with more than 1,048,576 rows (the physical limit of Excel) or any other limit that crashes your computer?
* you are not very good in Excel and it takes you hours of googling the right solution?
* you realize Excel/Google Sheets is not good enough and you need your IT department to figure it out?
* you just want to get the job done fast without any hassle?

That's why we think there must be a better way!
