CSV stands for "**c**omma **s**eparated **v**alues" and just means that a simple text file contains a list structured data. This structure is achieved by separating data entities with a ",". That's where the name is from. 

A simple example would be:
`name, email 
Steve Apple, steve@apple.com 
Mike Bryan, mikebryan@foo.net`

Sometimes CSV is also called "character separated value" file as the "," can be theoreticall replaced by other characters, typically a semicolon ";".

While JSON or XML data files can represent a more complex structure of data, CSV mainly is used for simple flat hierarchy data.
